    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Tom yum or tom yam is a type of <strong><em>hot</em></strong> and <strong><em>sour</em></strong> 
        Thai <strong><em>soup</em></strong>, 
        usually cooked with shrimp (prawn).
        Tom yum has its origin in Thailand.
    </p>
    <p>
        The words "tom yam" are derived from two Thai words. <em>Tom</em> refers to the <em>boiling process</em>,
        while <em>yam</em> means <em>'mixed'</em>. Tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, 
        with fragrant spices and herbs generously used in the broth. The soup is also made with 
        fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, 
        and crushed red chili peppers.
